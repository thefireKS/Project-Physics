# Project-Physics
My very first complete project in Unity w/ Vuforia

Made on Unity 2017.4.36f1
Also, download Vuforia and Android Build support to succesfully open the project

There are 3 target images to scan, sadly on APK only 2 possible to check

###How to use
Download an apk and point your camera to images on the google drive. By pressing "I" button you will get information about this "booth". 
By pressing "R" you will restart the scene.

Image target with the yellow frame - Electrical circuit with lamp, you can change it's color by pressing color blocks, or break it by cutting wires

Image target with the orange frame - The Goldberg Machine. Press on the blue handle, and you will see how the water goes out of the crane, when car passes it

Image target with the light blue frame - Chemistry booth. You can combine elements to get a new one
